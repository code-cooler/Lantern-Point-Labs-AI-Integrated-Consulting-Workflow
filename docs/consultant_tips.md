# Tips for New Consultants

## Using the Consulting Workflow Decision Tree

This document provides practical guidance on how to effectively use the Lantern Point Labs consulting workflow decision tree in your day-to-day consulting activities.

### General Tips

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Entire Workflow**: Before your first project, spend time understanding all phases and decision points in the workflow. This will help you anticipate next steps and plan accordingly.

2. **Use as a Guide, Not a Strict Rule**: The workflow provides a structured approach, but every client and project is unique. Feel empowered to adapt as needed while maintaining the core principles.

3. **Track Your Position**: During team meetings, reference your current position in the workflow to help align everyone's understanding of project status.

### Phase-Specific Guidance

#### Project Intake & Scoping
- Document all client requirements thoroughly
- Be explicit about what's in and out of scope
- Identify key stakeholders early

#### Kickoff & Alignment
- Set clear expectations about deliverables, timeline, and communication frequency
- Establish roles and responsibilities for both your team and the client team
- Create a shared project plan that maps to this workflow

#### Research & Problem Definition
- Use multiple research methods when possible (interviews, data analysis, observation)
- Document sources and methods to support findings
- Prioritize research questions based on project goals

#### Analysis & Synthesis
- Schedule regular team synthesis sessions
- Use frameworks and visual tools to organize insights
- Capture both the "what" (observations) and "so what" (implications)

#### Deliverable Production
- Start with a clear outline approved by senior team members
- Use LPL templates and style guides for consistency
- Allow sufficient time for internal review cycles

#### Client Engagement & Delivery
- Rehearse presentations when possible
- Anticipate client questions and prepare responses
- Take detailed notes on client feedback

#### Implementation Support
- Clearly define the scope and timeline for support
- Document implementation steps for client reference
- Create handover materials for sustainable change

#### Retrospective & Knowledge Capture
- Be honest about what worked and what didn't
- Capture both process learnings and domain insights
- Update templates and best practices based on project learnings

### Decision Point Guidance

#### Feasibility Check
- If returning to scoping, document specific concerns
- Consider both technical feasibility and stakeholder alignment

#### Data/Insights Check
- Use quality criteria: Is the data sufficient, relevant, and reliable?
- Consider if minority or edge case perspectives are represented

#### Internal Review Process
- Approach reviews with a collaborative mindset
- Be specific about what type of feedback you're seeking
- Allow adequate time for thoughtful review

### Common Challenges and Solutions

1. **Scope Creep**: If the client requests work outside the agreed scope, refer back to the project scope document and use the decision tree to show where additional work would fit in a potential extension.

2. **Delayed Client Feedback**: Establish feedback timelines upfront and explain how delays impact the rest of the workflow.

3. **Insufficient Research Access**: If you're unable to gather adequate data, document specific limitations and their impact on recommendations.

4. **Conflicting Stakeholder Needs**: Use the synthesis phase to explicitly map trade-offs and help clients make informed decisions.

5. **Rushed Deliverables**: Reference the workflow to explain why adequate time for each phase leads to better outcomes.

### Advanced Usage

As you become more experienced, you can use the workflow to:

1. **Estimate Projects**: Use historical data on how long each phase typically takes to create more accurate proposals.

2. **Train Clients**: Help clients understand how consulting work unfolds and where their input is most valuable.

3. **Delegate Effectively**: Assign team members to specific phases based on their strengths.

4. **Improve the Process**: Suggest refinements to the workflow based on project experiences.

Remember that the decision tree is a living tool that evolves with our collective experience. Your feedback on how to improve it is always welcome!

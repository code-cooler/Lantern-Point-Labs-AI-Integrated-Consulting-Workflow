## Overview of the Decision Tree

The AI-enhanced consulting workflow diagram is a flowchart that maps out the entire consulting process from initial client contact to project completion. It's designed to be read from top to bottom, with the project flowing through different phases and decision points.

### Basic Structure

- The workflow begins at the top with "Project Start" and ends at the bottom with "Project End"
- Main phases (rectangular boxes with light gray fill) represent major project stages
- Each main phase contains multiple sub-processes (rectangular boxes with light yellow fill)
- Diamond-shaped nodes represent decision points where the workflow can branch
- Purple nodes (with dashed borders) represent AI integration points
- Lines with arrows show the flow and relationships between steps

### How to Read the Diagram

1. **Start at the top** with "Project Start" and follow the arrows downward
2. At each step, perform the activities described in that node
3. At decision points (diamonds), follow the path that corresponds to your situation
4. Continue until you reach "Project End" at the bottom

## Tracking Project Progress

To track progress through the workflow:

1. **Use Checkpoints**: Mark each completed node with a date or status
2. **Hold Status Meetings**: Review current position in the workflow during team meetings
3. **Document Decision Outcomes**: Record the outcome of each decision point
4. **Create Phase Transitions**: Formally document transitions between major phases
5. **Update Project Plan**: Link tasks in your project management tool to specific workflow nodes

### Progress Tracking Template

You can use a simple table to track progress:

| Node | Description | Status | Completion Date | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | Project Start | Complete | 2023-06-01 | Signed SOW received |
| 2 | Project Intake & Scoping | Complete | 2023-06-08 | |
| 3 | Initial Client Meeting | Complete | 2023-06-02 | Minutes in shared drive |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Common Paths and Scenarios

### Standard Project Path
Most projects will follow this primary path:
1. Project Intake → Kickoff → Research → Analysis → Deliverable Production → Client Delivery → Retrospective

### Research-Heavy Project
Projects requiring extensive research may follow:
1. Project Intake → Kickoff → Research → [LOOP through Research phase multiple times] → Analysis → Deliverable Production → Client Delivery → Retrospective

### Implementation-Focused Project
Projects with significant implementation components:
1. Project Intake → Kickoff → Research → Analysis → Deliverable Production → Client Delivery → Implementation Support → Retrospective

### Multiple Deliverable Cycle
Projects with multiple deliverables:
1. Project Intake → Kickoff → Research → Analysis → Deliverable Production → Client Delivery → [Return to Analysis for next deliverable] → ... → Retrospective

## Customizing the Workflow

While the workflow provides a comprehensive structure, it can be adapted to specific project needs:

### When to Customize
- For unusually small or large projects
- When working in specialized industries with unique requirements
- For projects with non-standard delivery formats
- When client-specific processes must be incorporated

### How to Customize
1. Identify phases that need modification
2. Add, remove, or adjust sub-processes as needed
3. Document any customizations in the project plan
4. Ensure the team understands the customized workflow

### Workflow Compression
For smaller projects, you may compress the workflow by:
- Combining related sub-processes
- Simplifying decision points
- Reducing AI integration where not needed
- Streamlining the review process

Remember that the decision tree is a guide, not a rigid structure. The ultimate goal is to deliver value to the client in an efficient and effective manner.
